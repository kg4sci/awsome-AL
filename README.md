### Accelerating Materials Discovery through Active Learning: Methods, Challenges and Opportunities
# Abstract
Recent advances in high-throughput experimentation and computational techniques have ushered materials science into a data-driven era, yet traditional empirical and blind screening approaches struggle to keep pace with the vast compositional complexity and multi-scale mechanisms of modern materials discovery. High costs and time-intensive processes, such as synthesis experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, underscore the need for intelligent strategies to optimize resource use. Bayesian optimization and active learning (AL) have emerged as powerful tools to accelerate materials discovery by efficiently exploring parameter spaces and prioritizing the most informative samples for labeling. AL, in particular, reduces experimental and computational costs by selectively targeting samples that maximize model improvement, enabling rapid mapping of performance landscapes with significantly fewer experiments. This review introduces a novel classification of AL methods based on interaction and sampling scenarios, aligning with real-world experimental and computational conditions. It critically examines challenges, such as integrating domain knowledge and ensuring interpretable decision-making, while providing a practical roadmap for implementing AL in resource-constrained materials research environments.
